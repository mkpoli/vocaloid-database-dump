**歌詞
（[[SoundCloud>>http://soundcloud.com/tdoi/crush-the-devil-in-my-brain]]より転載）

Don't you think it's a fun
I was made on Christmas eve?

Do you believe in the god?
I envy you if you can

When you feel an ecstasy,
do you think it's by the god?

Do you know where's the god?
I want you to take me there

A devil, can you believe,
grows up in my mind, it's true

I just want to crack my head
I just want to set me free

Crush the devil in my brain
Slap my face and wake me up
Stop my tears, quench my thirst
I can not control myself

Pray the god that you believe in
I am not like what you think
Don't you know? Can't you see?
I will tell you what I am in hell

There is no god in this world
There is no one just like you
Don't you know? I love you
I don't want to say good bye

Crush the devil in my brain
Slap my face and wake me up
Stop my tears, quench my thirst
I can not control myself

Pray the god that you believe in
I am not like what you think
Don't you know? Can't you see?
I will tell you what I am in hell
