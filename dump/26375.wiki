**歌詞
（動画より書き起こし）

My bro always say
"You treat love like a cheap toy"

And what of that? It's no big deal
I will just do as I please

There is no doubt about it
Surely it's my usual way

I'm piling, upping love higher and higher
So I break and rewind

I don't mind if I miss this chance
My wonderland should be in another place

Filled love and life will wave like a game
between you and me. I think it maybe a real

I just want one lady who are over my
red string of fate

Can you believe it?
I am floating till at that time

I got a real pasting by my former girlfriend

I felt as if my last hour had come
I don't want to remember it

I find a next target
I can't gain an aim yet

I'm cruising, looking for more and more
So I re re re-rewind

Undefined lady will be mine
My crazy plan should be in my future

Filled love and life will wave like a game
between you and me. I think it maybe a real

I just want one lady who are over my
red string of fate

Can you believe it?
I am floating till at that time

　&italic(){I don't need to reload words}
　&italic(){Just your body all I want}

　&italic(){The goddess kneels in front of me}
　&italic(){It's right a historic secene}

　&italic(){Step this way, beautiful ladies}
　&italic(){Do ya want hold a wedding?}

　&italic(){Stop... I can't decide yet}
　&italic(){Give me some time please}

I don't mind if I miss this chance
My wonderland should be in another place

Filled love and life will wave like a game
between you and me. I think it maybe a real

Undefiend lady will be mine
My crazy plan should be in my future

Filled love and life will wave like a game
between you and me. I think it maybe a real

I just want one lady who are over my
red string of fate

Can you believe it?
I am floating till at that time
