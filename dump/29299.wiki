As I ride the train, the pouring rain continues falling
Bowing down, I smile. It's been a while until I started seeing

how the sky produced its tears again
oh when have I turned blind to notice all these

little things
I live right inside of a
beautiful world
Why? Do i fail to see such
little things
I am surrounded by everything
wonderful

Stepping out I trip, a little slip, a boy kept me standing
Bowing down, I smile, it's been a while until I realized that

there is still some good in this broken world
oh when have I turned blind to notice all these

little things
I live right inside of a
beautiful world
Why? Do i fail to see such
little things
I am surrounded by everything
wonderful

I live in a beautiful world
