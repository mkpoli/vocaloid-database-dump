Where are you now?
I miss your love.
i'm longing for you right now.
The things we did, the love we made.
It keeps me thinking all over again.

Where are you now?
i'm feeling down.
My world's dying without you.
I need your light, your hug so tight.
let me feel your love again.

i'm seeing you everywhere.
I am reminded of you again. 
upon every walk and turn i make.
it feels like you're by my side.

the smile you had, the kindness you showed me
it makes me want to love you better. 
but now its lost and fading, 
and I can only imagine it.

Where are you now?
I miss your love.
i'm longing for you right now.
The things we did, the love we made.
It keeps me thinking all over again.

Where are you now?
i'm feeling down.
My world's dying without you.
I need your light, your hug so tight.
let me feel your love again.

i'm silent and alone.
my eyes keep on crying
my heart keeps searching for you.

i can't take this anymore
these feelings that i have
Why can't I turn back time
and see you again?

Where are you now?
I miss your love.
i'm longing for you right now.
The things we did, the love we made.
It keeps me thinking all over again.

Where are you now?
i'm feeling down.
My world's dying without you.
I need your light, your hug so tight.
let me feel your love again.

Why are you gone?
i miss your love
i'm longing for you right now.
the things we did, the love we made.
It keeps me thinking all over again.

Why are you gone?
i'm feeling down.
My world's dying without you.
I can't stop cryin', Your love has faded, I can't feel it anymore.
