**歌詞
（[[Vocaloidv Lylics Wiki>>http://vocaloidlyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Our_Belief]]より転載）

Oh, a life is gone
Oh, gifted away from them
Oh, We say it's wrong
Oh, but we've forgotten

Oh, nobody knows
Oh, where everyone will go
oh, but we have faith
oh, and that's good enough

Oh, a life gone
oh, gifted away from them
oh, we say it's wrong
Oh, but we've forgotten

How do I believe
I want to be set free
Can someone tell me
What I need to see

How do I believe
I want to be set free
Can someone tell me
What I need to see

Oh, a life is gone
oh, gifted away from them
oh, we say it's wrong
Oh, but we've forgotten

Oh, nobody knows
Oh, where everyone will go
Oh, but we have faith
Oh, and that's good enough

Oh, a life is gone
Oh, gifted away from them
Oh, we say it's wrong
Oh, but we've fogotten

How do I believe
I want to be set free
can someone tell me
what I need to see

How do I believe
I want to be set free
can someone tell me
what I need to see

How do I believe
I want to be set free
can someone tell me
what I need to see

How do I believe
I want to be set free
can someone tell me
What I need to see
