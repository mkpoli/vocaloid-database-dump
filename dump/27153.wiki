**歌詞
（動画概要記載のURLより転載）

I remember the time that I spent with you.
It was various with happy time and sad time.

There wants to be me with you forever.
I pray heartily.
Are you a feeling same as me, too?
A feeling becomes one.

I think that there is all for this moment with you.
The small light to surround us gradually grows big.
We continue praying for all for this moment.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!

I think that there is all for this moment with you.
We always feel that the normal life is very happy.
We look up at this blue, wide sky and promise it.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!


This place to always visit is our sacred place.
Even if we have an obstacle, I will remember it.

There wants to be me with you forever.
I pray heartily.
What kind of event will happen to us after this?

I think that there is all for this moment with you.
The small light to surround us gradually grows big.
We continue praying for all for this moment.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!

I think that there is all for this moment with you.
We always feel that the normal life is very happy.
We look up ato this blue, wide sky and promise it.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!


I think that there is all for this momento with you.
The small light to surround us gradually grows big.
We continue praying for all for this moment.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!

I think that there is all for this moment with you.
We always feel that the normal life is very happy.
We look up at this blue, wide sky and promise it.
This thought be whirled up high in the sky!
