**歌詞
（[[bandcamp>>http://circus-p.bandcamp.com/track/addicted-revised-version]]より転載）

It started with an honest little crush 
Boy I didn't know what I was in for 
And I didn't think it'd amount to much 
Oh Baby, You left me wanting more 

And I'm repulsed by the way 
You keep me hooked on this game 
I don't know what to do... 
I'm hypnotized by the way 
you always know what to say 
I can't live without you... 

I can't speak I can't breathe I'm hanging on by a thread 
I've lost all sensibility You've bewitched me I'm obsessed 
I can't speak I can't think I feel I'm losing my head 
Oh you've got me addicted 

I didn't know that we'd end up this way 
I've shut out the whole world that's around me 
And I fear what would happen if I stay 
Oh Baby, this isn't Healthy 

And I'm repulsed by the way 
You keep me hooked on this game 
I don't know what to do... 
I'm hypnotized by the way 
you always know what to say 
I can't live without you... 

I can't speak I can't breathe I'm hanging on by a thread 
I've lost all sensibility You've bewitched me I'm obsessed 
I can't speak I can't think I feel I'm losing my head 
Oh you've got me addicted 

I can't move now 'cause you're holding me down 
And I can't see any way to get out 
I can't speak now though I'm trying to shout 
it all out so I'll be found 

Cause oh I'm repulsed by the way 
You keep me hooked on this game 
I can't live without you... 

I can't speak I can't breathe I'm hanging on by a thread 
I've lost all sensibility You've bewitched me I'm obsessed 
I can't speak I can't think I feel I'm losing my head 
Oh you've got me repeating what I've said 

I can't speak I can't breathe I'm hanging on by a thread 
I've lost all sensibility You've bewitched me I'm obsessed 
I can't speak I can't think I feel I'm losing my head 
Oh you've got me addicted 

I'm addicted
