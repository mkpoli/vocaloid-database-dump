**歌詞
（[[ピアプロ>>http://piapro.jp/t/LZ5n]]より転載）

Here I am, walking down again
In this path of never-ending pain and pleasure
Will somebody notice the stained dress I've been wearing
Since they took my hand and shoved me in this
Endless, morbid darkness?

"When the moon comes out,
I kill myself...
...once again."

I'm sick and tired, my tears have dried away
I'm lying down, too numb from the pain
I'm haunted by the memories of
My broken, sinful, violated self.

Losing my mind as days pass by
If I have a choice, will I choose my freedom
Will there be a better life for a sinner like me?
God, will you ever forgive me or will you forsake me?

There's no light
Everything's too late
No one can save me
No one can save me.

I'm sick and tired, my tears have dried away
I'm lying down, too numb from the pain
I'm haunted by the memories of
My broken, sinful, violated self.

I'm sick and tired, my tears have dried away
I'm lying down, too numb from the pain
I'm haunted by the memories of
My broken, sinful, violated...
