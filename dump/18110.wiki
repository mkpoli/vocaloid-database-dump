**曲紹介
- 告白できない男の子の曲。

**歌詞
If say I love you.
Could you answer the confession of my love?

If say I love you.
Do you evade answering and go anywhere?

If say I love you.
Do you answer "It's not interested in you"?

"If say I love you..."
I cannot move by feeling weak at the knees.


(uh...uh...uh...)


君の後ろ姿に　かける言葉もないまま
時が過ぎてゆくだけ　僕は　どうすればいいのだろう

If say I love you.
Could you answer the confession of my love?

If say I love you.
Do you evade answering and go anywhere?

If say I love you.
Do you answer "It's not interested in you"?

"If say I love you..."
I cannot move by feeling weak at the knees.


(If I say love you...)


If say I love you.
Could you answer the confession of my love?

If say I love you.
Do you evade answering and go anywhere?

If say I love you.
Do you answer "It's not interested in you"?

"If say I love you..."
I cannot move by feeling weak at the knees.
