※
Please give me your love.
I love you,so I sing for you forever.
Please give me the song.
Even if you forget me,I can sing.
Please give me your love.
I love you,so I sing for you forever.
Please give me the song.
Even if you forget me,I can sing.
※

You patted my cheek and gave a first song to me.
I love you from that day on.
I'm not a good singer,but I want to sing songs.
I still want to sing love songs next to you.

Please call me. Call me.
I like your voice and smile.
Please listen to my songs.
I keep singing for you forever.

You are all I need.
You are all in all to me.
Good times with you remains in me.
I do not forget you.
I never forget you.
Therefore, please forgive my singing of your song.
