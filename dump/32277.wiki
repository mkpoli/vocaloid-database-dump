**歌詞
（[[ピアプロ>>http://piapro.jp/t/Eza6]]より転載）

So many years have passed since you came last time, although I still be good.
When you were around me, I had no fear at all. Cause you keep devils away from me.

Now you've gone, but devils still exist and scare me. The wealthiest 1% devils.

Santa Claus, where are you? I need your help to ward off them.
Santa Claus, how I miss you! I need your help to protect me.

They overlook the world from Wall Street buildings and believe that they are gods.
For the mighty, strong and rich, Christmas is just a tool for making money much easier.

Oh please come back and revive dreams again for 99% people.

Santa Claus, where are you? We need your help to ward off them.
Santa Claus, how we miss you! We need your help to protect us.
