**歌詞
Oh my beautiful day!
I forget you to be a beautiful girl, to make you happy
Somebody! Come up to me and give me a smile & peace
Oh my beautiful girl!
Now look up to the sky and I can feel that the love is dancing 
Beautiful night, I say goodbye to a Lonely Summer Girl

When I was a little girl, I had a dream in my life
Just thinking a better way to not to be alone 
Someday I will be a happy girl
But there was nothing I could do there for me 

You'd better tell me the secret to fly away
So now I can show you everything in my mind 
And I can wish to be a lovely girl and I can stop to say that I am lonely babe

If you can tell me the truth I'd never know
Someday I'll be by your side and you'll make me laugh
So now, you show me the way to feel your love.... All the time

Oh my beautiful day!
You leave me to be a beautiful lady, to make me happy
Somebody! Come up to me and give me a smile & peace
Oh my beautiful lady!
Now I can dance for you
Everyday I wish for people dancing 
Beautiful night, I say goodbye to a Lonely Summer Girl

If you can tell the truth you'd never know
Someday I'll be by your side and I'll make you smile
Don't ever leave me alone.... I need your love all the time

Oh my beautiful day!
You leave me to be a beautiful lady, to make me happy
Somebody! Come up to me and give me a smile & peace
Oh my beautiful lady!
Now I can dance for you
Everyday I wish for people dancing 
Beautiful night, I say goodbye to a  Lonely Summer Girl

Oh my beautiful day!
I forget you to be a beautiful girl, to make you happy
Somebody! Come up to me and give me a Smile & peace
Oh my beautiful girl!
Now look up to the sky and I can feel that the love is dancing
Beautiful night, I say goodbye to a Lonely Summer Girl
