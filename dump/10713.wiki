**歌詞
（[[ピアプロ>>http://piapro.jp/content/mzm66omp3h2gmsyn]]より転載）

What made you stop? Problem is already solved.
What do you do, if you get a chance? Time is wasting away.

Please follow me. You can fly to the sky.
I know you could do it. Please trust me.

Hey, cool guy. Are you ready? Let's get together, go on a bad!
Nobody can stop our growth. We have already started to next stage!
You see?

　***

What made you cry? When you're sad, I'm sad.
Weep oneself out, if that makes you feel better.

What shall I do? I want to help you.
I'd like to see your smile. Please don't cry.

Hey, pretty girl. Are you ready? Let's get together, go on a party!
Nobody can disturb us. This world is just yours with me!!
I want you!

　***

(Keep your spirit high.) Don't give up before you try.
(Keep your spirit high.) Don't forget your dreams.
(Keep your spirit high.) Go the way that you believed in.
(Keep your spirit high.) I always trust you.


Hey, everybody! Are you ready? Let's get together, go one step!
Nobody can stop our growth. We have already started!
(2times)

Hey, everybody! Are you ready? Let's get together, go one step!
Nobody can stop our growth. We already became star!
You see?
