**歌詞
（動画内歌詞より転載）

CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
A STAR WAS BORN AND BURST IN MY BRAIN,

CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
A STAR WAS BORN AND BURST IN MY BRAIN,

INTRACEREBRAL SUBSTANCE LEAKING IN THE AIR
A LIVING MATTER WHICH WAS BORN BY THE FLAKE OF MY THOUGHT
I WILL BRING YOU THE BURST,
I WILL BRING YOU THE STAR,

CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
A STAR WAS BORN AND BURST IN MY BRAIN,

CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
A STAR WAS BORN AND BURST IN MY BRAIN,

INTRACEREBRAL SUBSTANCE LEAKING IN THE AIR
A LIVING MATTER WHICH WAS BORN BY THE FLAKE OF MY THOUGHT
I WILL BRING YOU THE BURST,
I WILL BRING YOU THE STAR,

CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
CLEAR AND COLD WINDS HIT ME
REMINDING ME OF FLEETING SOUNDS,
A STAR WAS BORN AND BURST IN MY BRAIN,

私の脳の中で生まれタ
星の集ダン
それらは音のナみとなって
宇宙をサ迷う
空気中に漏れ出したノウ内物質
私の思考の断片から生まれた
セイ命タイ
