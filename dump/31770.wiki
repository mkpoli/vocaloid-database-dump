**歌詞
（[[vocaloid.wiki>>http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Rose_%2B_Thorn]]より転載）

Just a tiny piece I have come to find
Goes a long, long way to change my mind
Right from the start I have always known
That the day would come when I’d end up alone

So…

Don’t speak
Don’t cry
‘til you say
Your goodbye
Cause
At the end
When it’s time for you to go
I want you to know

For every time I cried I laughed a little
For every time it hurt I smiled a little
Even when things were bad
I was never really sad
Now I’ll say “good-bye”
To the love that I had

There’s a tiny piece I have kept alive
So when that day comes you won’t see me cry
When it’s over, then I will let it die
With the knowledge that it once was mine

So...

Don’t say
A word
Cause I know
It’s over
And
At the end
When it’s time
For you to go
I want you to know

For every time I cried I laughed a little
For every time it hurt I smiled a little
Even when things were bad
I was never really sad
Now I’ll say “good-bye”
To the love that I had

Don’t speak
Don’t cry
‘Til I say
My goodbye
Cause
At the end
When it’s time
For me to go
I want you to know

For every time I cried I laughed a little
For every time it hurt I smiled a little
Even when things were bad
I was never really sad
Now I’ll say “good-bye”
To the love that I had

Now I’ll say “good-bye” to the love that I had…

Now I’ll say “good-bye” to the love that I had…
