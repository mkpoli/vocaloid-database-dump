**歌詞
（[[ピアプロ>>http://piapro.jp/content/k6mjqbafe71i64ue]]より転載）

I'm living in the decadent world.
That was built and broke again and again.
Do you know genuine solitude and despair?
I knew it in long ago ago...

I don't fear even in the dark.
Rather, I've lost "fear".
only dark.
only dark.
Even if I cry, even if I yell, nobody answers.
(I don't fear except living because my life is last....)
forever.


However did me make immortal body?
After all, only god knows this.
But, Is there God?
If there is God, I'll say Curse, Grudge, and Filthy words.


I don't fear even in the dark.
Rather, I've lost "fear".
only dark.
only dark.
Even if I cry, even if I yell, nobody answers.
(I don't fear except living because my life lost rule....)

Ah...
I might be even
in the dark
about the dark.
Even if I cry, even if I yell, nobody answers.
(I don't fear except living because my life is last....)
forever.
