**歌詞
（動画より書き起こし）

What is the best course we should take.
It's no way...
I don't care.
Anyway, it's good time.
What is the best course we should take.
It's no way...
No way...
So, no way...

There are no words to describe it.
Is it exaggerated?
I never thought I'd see U at the club.
I broke up with her one year ago.
So-called ex-girlfriend who ditched me once.

My eyes meet you.
My body feels something new.
So, we have often come here together before.
You haven't changed a bit.
Even if I don't say words,
we fall a victim to temptation at last...

Here comes the time that we want.
Emotions let it go.
Can you see?
I feel so scandalous, baby.
Under the cover of tonight,
two shadows move before light.
Things go right?
Maybe, we are drowning out the doubt.

Your lips are taste of the pasts.
Is it nostalgic flava?
Please interpret it as you wish.
I felt as if I had my heart seen through.
So-called ex-girlfriend who ditched me once

Time knows no mercy without diplomacy.
In this case, I'm very happy and very sad.
You haven't changed a bit.
Even if I don't say words,
we fall a victim to temptation at last...

Here comes the time that we want.
Emotions let it go.
Can you see?
I feel so scandalous, baby.
Under the cover of tonight,
two shadows move before light.
Things go right?
Maybe, we are drowning out the doubt.

Here comes the time that we want.
Emotions let it go.
Can you see?
I feel so scandalous, baby.
Under the cover of tonight,
two shadows move before light.
Things go right?
Maybe, we are drowning out the doubt.

Here comes the time that we want.
Emotions let it go.
Can you see?
I feel so scandalous, baby.
Under the cover of tonight,
two shadows move before light.
Things go right?
Maybe, we are drowning out the doubt.

What is the best course we should take.
It's no way...
I don't care.
Anyway, it's good time.
What is the best course we should take.
It's no way...
No way...
So, no way...
