**歌詞
（動画より書き起こし）

Wont cry alone, dont wanna know
the reason to let go
Lets not forget, were fighting for
a love that'll last forever more
Don't say goodbye, don't close your eyes
this is supposed to be
a future we are together


Your gentle word illuminates
my crooked heart beyond this glass cage
that Ive been confined in eternally
I can hardly speak
I can barely breathe from all these tears
I can no longer see.
a month without a voice
a life without a soul
I cry in despair
It was the end
But you came to me
And now I live with meaning

Its far away, so far away
we race the time tonight
the fears, the lies, the tears that dries
tomorrow will rise as you come forth
Lets not forget, were fighting for
emotions from the core
a future we have tomorrow

Wont cry alone, dont wanna know
the reason to let go
Lets not forget, were fighting for
a love that'll last forever more
Don't say goodbye, don't close your eyes
this is supposed to be
a future we are together


I will be here, no looking back
No reason not to go
Lets not forget, were fighting for
this love that had last forever more
We say goodbye, We close your eyes
We wish so faithfully
and dream that we are together

Its far away, so far away
It starts to fade today
the fears, the lies, the tears and crise
tomorrow will rise we have come forth
Lets not forget, were fighting for
emotions meant to be
in a future we have tomorrow

『Please stay with me...』
『ずっと。』
