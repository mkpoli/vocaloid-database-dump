**歌詞
//（[[引用元のページ名>>引用元のURL]]より転載）
Do you remember
You had the wings and you were never bound by anything

The wings were fluttered
You were flying like a bird in the sky just as you wanted to

Whatever hardship you may found never gave it up
You gave hope to a lot of people

Da Da Da Da Du Da Du Da Du
I thought you had the unlimited potential

Don't you remember
You had the wings and you were never bound by anything

Still, why did you stop
You might have taken wrong way somewhere without our noticing it

But it must be not too late yet
The wings aren't broken
Perhaps you just had to take time

Da Da Da Da Du Da Du Da Du
Now it's time for you to fly to the sky again
