Good morning Second Star
Sometimes I wonder where you are
And what the view is like from way up there
And though I know that I can’t see
As much from on my balcony
The city lights look pretty from down here

Tell me if I go straight on to morning
Would there be somebody there waiting for me?
Take my ship far past its mooring
I’ll turn it to the right, and sail on through the night

‘Cause Wendy’s on my mind
As she smiles in the moonlight
She’s waiting patiently
With a kiss that’s just for me
And sitting by her side
Is where I want to be

Ooh~mm

Hello there Second Star
It seems my dreams are much too far
Away to ever see the light of day
And though I’d like to put my trust
In faith and hope and pixie dust
I think that there must be a better way

Tell me if I could stay young forever
Would there be somebody there to share with me?
In a place where Never-Never
Is straight on to the right, so I’ll wish with all my might

‘Cause Wendy’s on my mind
As she smiles in the moonlight
She’s waiting patiently
With a kiss that’s just for me
And sitting by her side
Is where I want to be

But the clock is ticking on
Only a few minutes ‘til dawn takes you away
Will it take my dream away?
So before you disappear
I’ll leave a piece of myself here for you to find
Just a shadow is all I can leave behind

Ooh~lalala

Tell me if I go straight on to morning
Would there be somebody there waiting for me?
Take my ship far past its mooring
I’ll turn it to the right, and sail on through the night

‘Cause Wendy’s on my mind
As she smiles in the moonlight
She’s waiting patiently
With a kiss that’s just for me
And sitting by her side
Is where I want to be

Ooh~mm
