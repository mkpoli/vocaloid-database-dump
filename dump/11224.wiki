**歌詞
Mind sweeper...
Go with me...

Mind sweeper...
I kept seeking as if the fanatic.
I believe even if nobody understands.
Climb over!
anytime and anywhere,anymore...
May I throw everything other away?

"You are happy,as long as you can do it anyway,don't you?"
Everyone tease me.

I don't care that you call me just one-trick pony.
And I only advance on my road.
You got a problem?

Even incapable man succeed if he keeps making an effort.
Really think so?

Genius is only one remove from insanity.
That is to say,
both sides must be blamed.
Need me!

Mind sweeper...
Go with me...

Mind sweeper...
I kept seeking as if the fanatic.
I believe even if nobody understands.
Climb over!
anytime and anywhere,anymore!

Mind shaker...
I stopped going as if the chicken boy.
Is job to do meaningful for everybody's life?
But that's enough,
as long as only you realize me.

May I throw everything other away?
