Get down and spin a bit around
You'll never know when the danse floor'd stop lighting
Turn to the sters and get to flyin
above you, wait, what should you do?
Will you want give in and dance to the groove
or get to the sky?
Well, im sure you can do the two

Lift your hands up, party,
and the world will wacth you move
There is just nobody that could stop your party

Lights

Turn up the neat, Let's fill up the streets,
We follow your beat, You shan't feel defeated

Rise

Listen to me, it's time to believe, you have your own beat,
you take your own seat and-

As the scene gets too close to the bitter end
open the lights, put a smile and start it oll again
you take control of your life, life belongs to you

Fill Alive

Go Chase, the wind wants to race
Not everything in the world wants to block you
listen closely and you'll hear them sing
just for you, And what will you do?
Will you dance with the wind, give in to the groove
or ride it and fly?
Well, im sure you can do the two

Lift your hands up, party,
and the world will wacth you move
There is just nobody that could stop your party

Lights

Turn up the beat, Move up to your feet,
We follow your beat, You shan't fell defeated

Rise

Listen to me, it's time to believe, thet you take control,
you take your own seat and-

Take the path with the least frowns along the way
And though your last, just choose for you and it's okay
you take control of your life, belongs to you

Feel Alive

When you're stuck in a storm and you wonder why
try to find a mountain and begin to climb
Don't you ever quit, ride along with it

(Yeah!)

And with the thunder you should scream out loud,
Let the growls and lightning make your disco ground
I see you smile it's electrifyin'!
Cause nothing can stop your party rockin'

Lights

Turn up the beat, Move up to your feet,
We follow your beat, You shan't fell defeated

Rise

Listen to me, it's time to believe, thet you take control,
you take your own seat and-

As the scene gets too close to the bitter end
open the lights, put a smile and start it oll again
you take control of your life, life belongs to you

Fill Alive

Take the path with the least frowns along the way
And though your last, just choose for you and it's okay
you take control of your life, life belongs to you

Feel Alive
