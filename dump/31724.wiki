（[[Vocaloid Wiki>>http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/The_Tale_Of_A_10_Year_Old_Vampire_Queen]]より転載）

For a millenia on this pitiful planet
I've always been stuck with a childish form


Cursed for eternity is not as bad as it seems
When you're the reigning queen of all the obscene
But there is just one thing that makes it less enduring
When I go clothes shopping...everything's pink! (ew)


This story of a girl's tragedy through time
Centuries discreetly stalking the night
Hiding in the shadows here for you
Hunting down through the dark for you
Trying to spot your point of view
She is too short to follow you


This threatening midnight everything gives you a fright
Holding on to your life and I've come to play
You think I'm a lost kid, an image of innocence
I go in for the neck (HIYAA!!) ...there's no effect!! (Oh No!)


This story of a girl's tragedy through time
Centuries discreetly stalking the night
Hiding in the shadows here for you
Hunting down through the dark for you
Trying to spot your point of view
She is too short to follow you


One thousand years watching time go on and on
All the tears are gone 'cause I found what I want! 
(omg... GARLIC-LESS PIZZA? YAAAAAY!!)
A story of this girl's tragedy tonight
She's too young to buy one thing by herself
(NOOOOOOOOOOOO!! OTL)


This story of a girl's tragedy through time
Centuries discreetly stalking the night
Hiding in the shadows here for you
Hunting down through the dark for you
Trying to spot your point of view
She is too short to follow you Ooh...
