**歌詞
If you desire,
I will give all for you

Untill...
you love me, you love me
and love that bitch girl?

I hope you to see me forever.
Only, only me, only me,
so my heart is going out!

As this world is coming untied.
So that witch do!

I can know anything and
everything about you.
Only I,
that witch cannot do this!

If... you choose not me but her
and you break out this paradise,
You have to feel
"My heart is crying!"

In this silence
darker than darkness.

Tell me,
Tell me why, Tell me why,
Why don't you look only me!

Escape form
this sleepless night.
Way is only "Kill!"

Never can I forget you,
I want you
frustration flare up.
It's as a matter of course.

So our soul is
linking each other
to the end on the Red Heven.
You have to swear,
"I'll stay with you."

As this world is coming untied.
Where is my place?

I can know anything and
everything about you.
Only I,
that witch cannot do this!

...If you choose not me but her
and you break out this paradise,
You have to feel
"My HURT is crying!"

Never can I forget you,
I want you,
frustration flare up.
It's as a matter of course.

So our soul is
linking each other
to the end on the Red Heven

You have to notise.

"You are only mine!"
