**歌詞
（&s(){[[ピアプロ>>https://piapro.jp/t/MXqN]]}より転載）

Love is there. You catch up idea finally.
Have you already known you are loved a lot?

Believe you. Conserve it. Your love is surely.
I need you, I miss you, I love you.

An easy kiss is a bitter on weekend.
Very easy point is your weakness.
I feel of that is happiness.
I just keep on tired.
Reluctance is piercing on weekday
In daily life just like always. 
What do you do? Where are you?

It turns around right now.
I am ready to be a kiss.
Because I keep waiting for misstake.
I love you!
