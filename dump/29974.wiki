**歌詞
（[[PIAPRO>>http://piapro.jp/t/FUiq]]より転載）

I want the strength is not afraid even regret
Now I just keep walking staring at the only previous

I wanted to see a dream that does not end forever by your side
because the scenery to see from here is comfortable

I break the fantasy that got rusty and untie the chain of the heart
I will stand up again and again this life untill exhausted

The hand does not yet arrive to that too high cloud
The blue and white that nobody knows

Even if only anything takes time, I catch it by this hand
Until a day laughable together someday

I hugged the memory that does not fade
There is no hesitation nothing　Before disappearing

I just found an answer
I will reach for the sky now

Your good old words continue still shaking my beating
I continue believing that I can keep a promise with you

I want the strength is not afraid even regret
Now I just keep walking staring at the only previous

The clock which stopped has begun to work

Continue running until of breath

the past, the present, and the future
to pass up while intersecting
someday,Until the day when a wish comes true

Do you hear this voice deep into your heart?
Do you still remember my voice?
I love you always thinking of you

I just found an answer
I will reach for the sky now

Even if only anything takes time, I catch it by this hand
Until a day laughable together someday

I hugged the memory that does not fade
There is no hesitation nothing　Before disappearing

I just found an answer
I will reach for the sky now
