（[[YouTube動画ページ>>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxAjpZ2sqVY]]より転載）

It's 2 am and I'm here on my own
But I really hate being alone, don't you know
That I need you every night and day
And I can't carry on without you,

My love
Did you mean it when you said that you'd wait
Or was it all just a simple mistake, even though
You already told me that the warmest place
Was my embrace

Tell me why
You said
It hurts to see you like this
Should love
be hurting this way
My love,
In this world of hate
Run away and find a place for you and me

You said
It's time for us to move on
Our love
It had its turn
My love,
Don't ever forget and
Run away and find a place where you can be free

Pit a pat goes the sound of the rain
Our years of love are just slipping away, I don't know
How you can even stand it as
all that we made is soon betrayed, did you know

You're the reason I don't look too far
My heart can't bear any more scars, and still I
thought I still needed you
But right now oh I don't want to try

Tell me why
You said
It hurts to see you like this
Should love
be hurting this way
My love,
In this world of hate
Run away and find a place for you and me

I said
It's you who hurts me like this
No love
Should bring me this pain
My love,
I want to forget and
Run away and find a place where I can be free 

I said
You won't get to hurt me like this
No more
Will I feel this pain
My love
So I can forget
I'll run away and find a place where I can be free


you and me
