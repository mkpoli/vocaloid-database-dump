**歌詞
（&s(){[[ピアプロ>>https://piapro.jp/t/8Zd0]]}より転載）

Call me whenever you need me.
I'm Lily, as you know your sweet little lover.
Notepad and desktop, all kinds of mobile,
bringing you so pleasant songs through the smile videos. 

Show me how to make you stop babying me 
and thinking highly of yourself.
You're always saying you’re right,always saying that I'm wrong. 
There is no phrase too high nor too low for my singing and humming.
Don’t you know my repertoire filled with soul and passions? 

Take it easy, and let’s enjoy your life.
Time is running out fast so If I were you, 
I'll never mind any failure.

Call me whenever you need me.
I'm Lily, as you know your sweet little lover.
Running on the extranet, 
across the World Wide Web , 
providing all components on demand.

You can access me without passwords.
Remember day and night I’ll be with you.
Notepad and desktop, 
all kinds of mobile,
bringing you so pleasant songs through 
the smile videos. 

La la la la….
