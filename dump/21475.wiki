**歌詞
//（[[引用元のサイト>>引用元のURL]]より転載）
If anything what you love is trampled by someone.
Then, what do you do?
I want you to think about it.

I guess one man stands up and counterattacks it.
For instance, he doesn't care even if he isn't right.
Indiscreet people gather and the riot expands
Irrelevant people are involved by them

The merciless attack starts.
It's a really unnecessary, miserable religious war
It's beyond the range of understanding.
Everyone knows.
Yes, you also know...
What should I do... you do... we do for that

Freedom of religion is promised in my region
A kind of subculture is practiced like a cult religion
Blind love Sometimes replaces the faith.
The difference of the belief causes a wrong process
It's hard to understand if we sees from the outside.

If anything what you love is denied by your lover
Can you accept it all?
It's time to decide it

I don't want you to become a mindless terrorist.
For instance, it hurts you even if you are right.
Indiscreet people gather and the riot expands
Irrelevant people are involved by them

The merciless attack starts.
It's a really unnecessary, miserable religious war
It's beyond the range of understanding.
Everyone knows.
Yes, you also know...
What should I do... you do... we do for that

The merciless attack starts.
It's a really unnecessary, miserable religious war
It's beyond the range of understanding.
Everyone knows.
Yes, you also know...
What should I do... you do... we do for that

The merciless attack starts.
It's a really unnecessary, miserable religious war
It's beyond the range of understanding.
Everyone knows.
Yes, you also know...

The merciless attack starts.
It's a really unnecessary, miserable religious war
It's beyond the range of understanding.
Everyone knows.
Yes, you also know...
What should I do... you do... we do for that
