**歌詞
//（[[引用元のサイト>>引用元のURL]]より転載）
SNATCH YOU FROM YOUR
HOME YOUR SECRET ADMIRER YOU, I ADORE

LOVE AND GREED IS OVERRATED
BUT ITS HOW I FEEL COMPLICATED

WALLS AND BARRICADES
DISCONNECTED FROM OUTSIDE LANES
AROUND THE SEA OF MERCURY
SHACKLED ETER NALLY

LATCHING WITH A CHAIN
EVEN TELL YOU STRAIN
FEELING OF YOUR PAIN
MAKE YOU BLIND BUT YOU'LL BE FINE

BULLET IN YOUR VEIN
SHOOT THROUGH STILL REMAIN
FRAGMENT IN YOUR BRAIN
FORCE REMIND YOU'RE FOREVER MINE

THIS IS LOVE
THIS IS LIFE
I'm the only one who treat you right

ASYLUM
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
I'm the projectile
I'm Your Ricochet

ABSOLUTE ISOLATION
TEMPTATION TO THE FULL DAMNATION

NO MORE LIGHT
NO MORE FREEDOM
LIKE AN ANIMAL WITH DELIRIUM

THIS IS NEITHER RIGHT NOR WRONG
IF YOU LEAVE YOU'RE NOWHERE TO BELONG
THERE'S NO OPTION OF "GOODBYE"
SURRENDER AND COMPLY

NOTHING TO REGAIN
ONLY BLOOD STAIN
REMORSE YET NO REFRAIN
FELT IT ALL BUT STILL WAN'T FALL

BULLET IN YOUR VEIN
SHOOT THROUGH STILL REMAIN
FRAGMENT IN YOUR BRAIN
THROW YOUR PRIDE CAUSE YOU CAN'T HIDE

MATTER OF
LIFE AND DEATH
You don't need to care just be in my sight

GUN POINT
TO YOUR HEAD
Don't you try to run
I'll shoot you if you dare

I'M SANE STILL NOT MAD STILL HUMANE
YOU MAY HATE ME BUT I STILL WON'T ABSTAIN
I'M SANE STILL NOT MAD STILL HUMANE
MARKED WITH STRIATION SCARS
I'TS NOW WHO YOU ARE
IT'S NOW WHO YOU ARE

THIS IS LOVE
THIS IS LIFE
I'm the only one who treat you right

ASYLUM
YOU CAN'T ESCAPE
I'm the projectile
I'm Your Ricochet
