（[[vocaloid.wiki>>http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Eulogy_for_Abel]]より転載）

Open up your eyes
Did you ever notice the sky is falling down?
Crash into the wave
Reaching out to save just one last fragment

And still she cries
The mother of Abel
The queen of the lie

The queen of the lie

Clinging to the rock
Breaking through the lock that has kept you out

Maybe now you’ll find
That the love that you wanted was all in your mind

All in your mind...

And still she cries
The mother of Abel
The queen of the lie

He’ll watch it die
The father of Abel
The husband of lies

They’re watching it die

And my heart is torn
To know that once more
I’m helpless to stop it

If I had one wish
I swear it’d be this
I’d cleanse you all in this flood

But

Now the love is gone
Swept away with dawn’s last bright color

Who can ever say
That the world wasn’t to be this way

And still she cries
The mother of Abel
The queen of the lie

He’ll watch it die
The father of Abel
The husband of lies

I’ll close my eyes
With the last breath of Abel
The son of the lie

Tell me why...
