**歌詞
（[[PIAPRO>>http://piapro.jp/t/uNK8]]より転載）

Something happens in my life
what is gonna be?
Feeling so damn warm inside
89 degrees!

Melting my core as well
What i have to do?
Machine girls can't read this word
System shut down!
Something happens in my cards
what is gonna be?
Feeling so damn hot inside

Any chance to freeze?
Let me check my Database
I can get this word!
This time i found a whole new world for me!

Is this love?
Ahhh
That's coming into my life
Yes it's love
That's coming into my life

Something happens in my life
what is gonna be? 
I look into my solid drive
But it's hard to see it

People lives just for this word
what i have to do?
Machine girls can't read this word!
System shut down!

Something happens in my cards
what is gonna be?
I'm feeling like i cannot get
what they want to say me

Let me check my Database
I have to get this word!
This time i found a whole new world for me!
