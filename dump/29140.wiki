**歌詞
（投稿動画内より転載）

I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
And He does nothing but laugh.

I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
We said with a snicker and whisper voice.


For example
I get most beautiful women, but immediately lost.
A bad habit has man is too young.

He's adorable.
stupid dream singing.
I was stare up at the you.


I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
And He does nothing but laugh.

I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
We said with a snicker and whisper voice.


Immediately love started but finished.
No regret, no resentment no nothing.

"Do you remember? I just remembered."
"Me too."
"It was just another."
1 year will already pass since then.


I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
And He does nothing but laugh.

I know, I know You're nothing to me now.
We said with a snicker and whisper voice.
