**歌詞
（[[Vocaloid Lylics Wiki>>http://vocaloidlyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Memory/Circus-P]]より転載）

I'm not sure what we're doing
I don't know how we got in
This situation.

But I think that I like it
The rendezvous of our lips
We make a perfect fit.

Oh,this is love?(Oh,this is love?)
I can't tell what we've done(I can't tell what we've done)
Oh,this is right?(Oh,this is right?)
I don't know what to do...(I don't know what to do...)

Whisper to me It will set me free
(Don't talk to me just let me be)
There's no way that I'd expect this tonight
(didn't expect this tonight).

Nothing is wrong
(something is wrong it is all gone)
My thoughts,they are gone
It wont be for long
But I'll remember this forever
(But I'll remember this forever)
We will never forget
(I won't forget)

"I want you! I need you! I love you!
Never leave this fantasy! Paradise!
This is everything I wanted"

Don't know you..."who are you? where are we?"
"This isn't right! What are you? What am I?
I can't stop and I don't know why...

Oh,this is love?(Oh,this is love?)
I can't tell what we've done(I can't tell what we've done)
Oh,this is right?(Oh,this is right?)
I don't know what to do...(I don't know what to do...)

Whisper to me It will set me free
(Don't talk to me just let me be)
There's no way that I'd expect this tonight
(didn't expect this tonight).

Nothing is wrong
(something is wrong it is all gone)
My thoughts,they are gone
It wont be for long
But I'll remember this always
(But I'll remember this always)
We will never forget
(I won't forget)

Come stay with me,I'm sure we'll be free
A worthless pair,this isn't fair
It will be fun! You are the one!
Who said this is ultimate bliss?

Whisper to me It will set me free
(Don't talk to me just let me be)
There's no way that I'd expect this tonight
(didn't expect this tonight).

Nothing is wrong
(something is wrong it is all gone)
My thoughts,they are gone
It wont be for long
(Can't stop)
But I'll remember this always
(But I'll remember this always)
We will never forget
(I won't forget)
