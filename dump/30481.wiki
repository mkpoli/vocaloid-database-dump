**歌詞
He's keeping me at a distance.
I feel like sink to the bottom of the sea.
And reach for the surface of the water.

But this hand can't possibly reach.
Cause I know that I'm out of his sight.
I know, yes I know, yes I know.

(I wanna be close to your heart.)
(And my eyes follow you even in the dark.)
(Crying in the night is painful cause I miss you.)

Everywhere you go with the other girl,
I'd not accept my fate, can't let you go.
Go on and tear me down, drop in the depth of misery.
I never knew that your smile so hurt me.


I still remember the feel of my lips 
when you were kissing me at night.
And remember the word of your love.

But my heart will possibly break.
Cause I know that I'm out of his sight.
I know, yes I know, yes I know.

(I wanna be close to your heart.)
(And my eyes follow you even in the dark.)
(Crying in the night is painful cause I miss you.)

Even if you go too far away,
I won't wholly efface you from my heart.
Go on and tear me down, drop in the depth of misery.
I never make a sincere smile because of you.


Everywhere you go with the other girl,
I'd not accept my fate, can't let you go.
Go on and tear me down, drop in the depth of misery.
I never knew that your smile so hurt me.

Even if you go too far away,
I won't wholly efface you from my heart.
Go on and tear me down, drop in the depth of misery.
I never make a sincere smile because of you.
