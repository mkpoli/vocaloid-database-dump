**歌詞
（動画より書き起こし）

In the night of shooting star
Feel my loneliness
I'm away from you
Let me hear your voice and heart beat
To make me relieved
Like a shining blue moon
In the twilight sky

Here has come a rainy day
I wonder about you
I'm missing you
But I can't reach there any more
There's no way to see you
'Cause the morning dawns soon
Anyway…

I just sing for you every night
Toward the sky, higher than the sky
So make my wish come true
Just wanna be with you
I wait for the day one year later

Here has come a special day
My praying became true
In the bluest sky
Scattering the world with the flower
The two stars gonna meet
I don't want to get back
To where I used to be...

Your smile heals me at any time
Fills my heart and soul with so much love
Gimme your sweet word with a sweet voice
To make me so happy
Hope the splendid time lasts
Forever...

I will think of you every day
So take me to the end of the world
But I knew all along
That I should not be with you
So see you again one year later

I wait for the day one year later
