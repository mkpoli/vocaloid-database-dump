**歌詞
What have you seen before?
What are there beyond your hazy eye?
Even if there are something, it's unnecessary for me.

What have you felt before?
Does your action include your real heart?
Things that you have dropped, it's necessary for me. 

The box you're holding dear is sadly empty.

They disappear one after another.
Is it only me to have been left behind here?

Stay with me.
Please don't leave.
Granting the sequal to a broken dream
So stay with me.

You are always looking for excuse.
Color of the sky to see is different from you.
I am always looking for the truth.
Warmth of the skin to feel is different from me.

I just continued running straight.
When I noticed, it was me to have been in the darkness.

You advanced to the light were totally like the machine.

Stay with me.
Please don't leave.
Granting the sequal to a broken dream
So stay with me.

Why do you not step forward to the one step?
You noticed by yourself that smile is glazed.
My heart was filled with grief.

Waste your time
Waste your life
Finally what is left on your hands?

Stay with me.
Please don't leave.
Granting the sequal to a broken dream
So stay with me.
