**歌詞
（[[Vocaloid Lylics Wiki>>http://vocaloidlyrics.wikia.com/wiki/Synthesized_Love]]より転載）

The light is fading	
From this affection we hold	
All that we're losing	
Thrown out in the dark and cold	
The love that we shared	
Replaced by lust and hatred	
Can't help but feel like	
All romance we had is dead	

Time without you	
Spent on strangers and I	
Feel lost from you	
The touch can't be compared	

The light is fading	
From this affection we hold	
All that we're losing	
Thrown out in the dark and cold	
The love that we shared	
Replaced by lust and hatred	
Can't help but feel like	
All romance we had is dead	

This emotion	
can't exist in this world	
Loving just one	
Can't feed my desire	

The light is fading	
From this affection we hold	
All that we're losing	
Thrown out in the dark and cold	
The love that we shared	
Replaced by lust and hatred	
Can't help but feel like	
All romance we had is dead	

(Aah...)	

Synthesized Love	
Destroying everything	

The light is fading	
From this affection we hold	
All that we're losing	
Thrown out in the dark and cold	
The love that we shared	
Replaced by lust and hatred	
Can't help but feel like	
All romance we had is dead
