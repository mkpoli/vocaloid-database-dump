**歌詞
Change is in the air love don't you feel it now?
I can't recall it love but, don't you feel it now?
The tides are turning fast love don't you feel it now?
The end is coming soon love don't you feel it now?

I've seen your face I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall
I've seen this place I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall

Once before the fall
Once before the fall

This land has grown sick, love Don't you see it now?
Don't you dare look back, love Don't you see it now?
Time is running out, love Don't you see it now?
Tried by fire, love Don't you see it now?

I've seen your face I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall
I've seen this place I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall

Once before the fall
Once before the fall

I've seen your face I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall
I've seen this place I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall

I've seen your face I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall
I've seen this place I've seen it all before.
Once before the fall

Once before the fall
Once before the fall
