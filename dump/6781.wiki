**歌詞
far from here but I will be there
be there

I said Iwanna be there.
but you answerd that's only a dream.

I surely felt I saw vague light.
but you turned off
oll that you can't see.

Every night, I hope that the
world arourd me Changes. and I sleep.
Every morning. I wake up
in usual air. I go to your home.

The Fragments of Cloud
you can't see.
you'll erase the Cloud
by the wind named 'Real'

The Fragments of Cloud
you can't see.
you'll erase the cloud
by the wind named 'Real'

Both you and I have
the same senses.

The Fragments of Cloud
you can't see.
you'll erase the Cloud
by the wind named 'Real'

The Fragments of Cloud
you can't see.
you'll erase the cloud
by the wind named 'Real'

Both you and I have
the same senses.
