**歌詞
In the world where inscrutable events are filled
as far as the eye can reach, I grope the tomorrow's significance.

Although there are many things which I cannot comprehend at all,
I want to find out the "justfication" for existence.

We should detect plus+ of the "psychic reality【time】" for being
rather than the "material reality【reason】" for existing.
I bring back my vanished statements and my lost dreams.
And so.... I've been "plus＋【advance】".

I live in this world on this memorable day.
I've been searched the "purpose【meaning】" for existing.
When my heart are broken, I can make great plus＋.
I bring back my vanished statements and my lost dreams.
And so.... I've been "plus＋【advance】".


There will be filled by a lot of methods and discussions.
My words are scratched out in the appropriate places.
何もかも流れ流されてく　夢（みらい）は決して消える事はないさ
Truth is one thing.... The dream which I pursue is one and only dream.

We should detect plus+ of the "psychic reality【time】" for being
rather than the "material reality【reason】" for existing.
I bring back my vanished statements and my lost dreams.
And so.... I've been "plus＋【advance】".

I live in this world on this memorable day.
I've been searched the "purpose【meaning】" for existing.
When my heart are broken, I can make great plus＋.
I bring back my vanished statements and my lost dreams.
And so.... I've been "plus＋【advance】".
