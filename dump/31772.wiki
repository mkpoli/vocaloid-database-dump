**歌詞
（[[vocaloid.wiki>>http://vocaloid.wikia.com/wiki/Rain_%2B_Virus]]より転載）

Tracing all
The shadows on my wall
The way you used to do

My heart recalls
With each teardrop that falls
What time turned us into

Thinking back on
Those moments long gone
There's nothing I'd want to change
Is that wrong?

Rain clouds slowly gathering
Thunder softly echoing
I've given into all

Washing away my heartache
Such a bitter pill to take
Only to find in the end

I've caught the virus again

In the sky
The light flickers and dies
With every move I make

So I'll sleep on
Hide myself from the dawn
Too hard to stay awake

Looking back to
That person you knew
Would you ever recognize
What I've become?

Rain clouds slowly gathering
Thunder softly echoing
I've given into all

Washing away my heartache
Such a bitter pill to take
Only to find in the end

I've caught the virus again

Washing away my heartache
Such a bitter pill to take
Only to find in the end

I've caught the virus again
