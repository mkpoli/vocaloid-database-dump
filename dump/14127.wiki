**歌詞
Once it was an ordinary city
Like your neighbor,or family
Nobody awoke to her
Her fragments,dim colored her fragments
I could not take them and spill over out of my hands
They are frail,I feel that they are "voic."
You feel that they are "word"
and we feel that they are "love"

Once again,I want to see them
even if it is very painful
I think that there are many happiness and more
and great existence is
Let's sing a song which we have forgotten
since very very old time ago
Let's play the fragments,and maybe we can know them
Let's make Land and see or listen!

Once they were images that we saw and herd as "everyday" Forgot?
We therefore can make them
Only imagine! create! which felt
Voices and words in air will be melody,
your memories be shine
Song of "Airs" plays old our days,
children's laughing,dinner's perfume
Ordinary things we lost were succeeded long

Once it was an ordinary city
Like your neighbor,or family
Nobody awoke to her
Her fragments,dim colored her fragments
I take them many times,but never got their pieces

Once again,I want to touch them
even if it is very difficult
I know that there are many beautiful words
and melodies it make up
Let's listen to their vibration,
They talk to us their soundless words
Let's play the words,and remember lost days
Let's arrive at your old days and truth.

Once they were images and many people know,and he neighbor. Forgot?
We therefore can give it to
our children,and their world they feel,some day 
Voices and words in air will be melody,memories be shine
Song of "Airs" plays old our days,
children's laughing,dinner perfume.
Ordinary things we lost were succeeded long...

Once they were images that we saw and herd as "everyday" Forgot?
We therefore can make them
Only imagine! create! which felt
Voices and words in air will be melody,
your memories be shine
Song of "Airs" plays old our days,
children's laughing,dinner's perfume
Ordinary things we lost were succeeded long...
