**歌詞
//（[[引用元のサイト>>引用元のURL]]より転載）
Is this LOVE?
It's so complicated
Sometimes, feels both sad and happy
The mood changes like the canvas of LOVE
Of LOVE

You and me
We are weird, but we like it
Over time we just got the hang of it
It is like a color changeable
LOVE LOVE LOVE

I am forever with you
Trials and errors we have pulled through
Everything it takes two
You may be my every scar but still my love you are
I am a fool who still love you
Heart and soul all in one all to you
In the palette shades of blue
Colorful is want you are
Colorful shining star

Yeah, I want you to do want you did was right
I know you want me all day night
its you, me and the candle lights
its me, you and excite
paint on your skin, I'll show how
I'll mix the colors right now pose up
I will paint you up

The moon shining down from the night sky
City lights reflects from your eyes
Endless gazing to thet color changeable love
LOVE LOVE

I am forever with you
Trials and errors we have pulled through
Everything it takes two
You may be my every scar but still my love you are
I am a fool who still love you
Heart and soul all in one all to you
In the palette shades of blue
Colorful is want you are
Colorful shining star

I am forever with you
Trials and errors we have pulled through
Everything it takes two
You may be my every scar but still my love you are
I am a fool who still love you
Heart and soul all in one all to you
In the palette shades of blue
Colorful is want you are
Colorful shining star
