**歌詞
（[[PIAPRO（風月氏）>>http://piapro.jp/a/content/?id=7lmthr4yi29gqywm]]より転載）

Kindness so much that I couldn't hold in my hands
Conscientiousness so much that I felt rather pain
They were always within my reach
But somehow I couldn't show them to you

Please tell me
Could I reply to your heart enough?
You, in my memory, always just smiled to me

Why can't I stop my tears?
Because of the melody lapping my heart?
Because of the words breaking my heart?
I can do nothing but lay myself in the music flow
But warmth of my tears shows that I'm still here

I look into your eyes and you smile at me gently
Understanding each other without any words
It is easy to call it "happiness"
But after all I couldn't tell to you

Please tell me
Could I make you happy enough?
Happiness, in my heart, I hope you felt like me

Why can't I stop my tears?
Because of the melody lapping my heart?
Because of the words breaking my heart?
I can do nothing but lay myself in the music flow
But warmth of my tears shows that I'm still here

Please smile again
Just one more time
Like you did at that time
Like you did just for me
Now I know
Only your smile can stop my tears

Why can't I stop my tears?
Because of the melody lapping my heart?
Because of the words breaking my heart?
I can do nothing but lay myself in the music flow
But warmth of my tears allows that I'm still here
